GitWall is a Flutter application that lets you fetch and set stunning wallpapers directly from GitHub repositories. Whether you're a developer, designer, or just someone who loves cool wallpapers, GitWall provides an easy way to discover and personalize your device with unique images hosted on GitHub.

## Project Overview

Key features include:

*   Browsing and selecting high-quality wallpapers from GitHub.
*   Manually and automatically setting wallpapers.
*   Caching for offline access to your favorite wallpapers.
*   Customizable settings for personalized wallpaper experiences.
*   Easy configuration of GitHub repository sources.

## Features

*   **Wallpaper Preview:** Preview wallpapers before setting them as your background.
*   **Manual Wallpaper Setting:** Set your desired wallpaper with a single tap.
*   **Automatic Wallpaper Updates:** Configure automatic wallpaper changes at set intervals.
*   **Wallpaper Caching:** Enjoy offline access to your favorite wallpapers through caching (see `lib/services/cache_service.dart`).

*   **Startup Configuration:** Initial application setup and configuration handled gracefully (see `lib/services/startup_service.dart`).

## GitHub Integration

GitWall leverages the GitHub API to fetch wallpapers from specified repositories (see `lib/services/github_service.dart`). Here's how it works:

*   **API Endpoints:** Uses the GitHub API to retrieve image files from specified repositories. Specifically, it might use the `Contents API` to list files in a repository and download them.
*   **Data Fetched:** The application fetches image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) and metadata (e.g., file name, repository information) from the GitHub API.
*   **Repository Configuration:** Users can configure which GitHub repositories GitWall should use as wallpaper sources.  This is typically done through the settings screen.

> **Configuration Example:**
>
> To add a new repository, you would typically add its name and owner to a configuration file or through the app's settings.  For example:
>
> 1.  **Flutter SDK Setup:** Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed and configured on your system. If not, follow the official Flutter installation guide: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the GitWall repository to your local machine:

bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd gitwall
    1.  **App Launch:** Launch the GitWall application on your device.
2.  **Browse Wallpapers:** Navigate through the available wallpapers from the configured GitHub repositories.
3.  **Wallpaper Preview:** Tap on a wallpaper to preview it in full screen.
4.  **Set Wallpaper:** Tap the "Set Wallpaper" button to apply the selected image as your device's background.
5.  **Automatic Updates:** Configure automatic wallpaper updates in the settings menu (see `lib/services/settings_service.dart`) to have your wallpaper change automatically at specified intervals.
6.  **Manage Cache:** Clear or manage cached wallpapers via the settings screen to free up storage space (see `lib/services/cache_service.dart`).

## Configuration

GitWall offers several configuration options to customize your experience:

*   **Wallpaper Update Frequency:** Set the frequency at which GitWall automatically updates your wallpaper (e.g., daily, weekly).
*   **Cache Size Limit:** Configure the maximum amount of storage space GitWall can use for caching wallpapers.
*   **GitHub API Authentication:** Configure your GitHub API token (if required) to increase API rate limits.

> **Example Configuration in `settings_service.dart`:**
>
> *   **GitHub API Errors:** If you encounter errors related to the GitHub API, ensure that the configured repositories are accessible and that you have not exceeded the API rate limit. Consider using a personal access token.
*   **Wallpaper Setting Failures:** If the wallpaper fails to set, ensure that the application has the necessary permissions to modify system settings.
*   **Caching Problems:** If you experience issues with caching, try clearing the cache or increasing the cache size limit in the settings.
